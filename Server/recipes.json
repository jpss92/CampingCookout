Bake over a low flame for 20 to 30 minutes, or until firm in the center. When baking over hot coals, place the pan on a low grill, on a three rock stand in the coals or directly on coals. Place coals on top of the lid (like a dutch oven) to distribute heat more evenly. Baked foods are more likely to burn on the bottom than the top. To prevent burning, check the temperature of your coals before placing a pan on them. Hold your hand about six inches above the coals; it should be hot, but you should be able to keep your hand in place for eight seconds."

If you like more candies in center, core a larger portion of the apple and enjoy the cut out part as you wait for it to cook These are very hot and should be opened at top and left to sit for about 10 minutes after removing from coals before trying to eat them."

    "instructions": [
        "Directions: (It's not as complicated as it sounds.) Preheat both Dutch ovens. Fry bacon until crisp in DO #1. Remove bacon to a plate covered with a paper towel. When cool, crumble. Remove ½ of the bacon drippings to DO #2, add the chopped red and Walla Walla onions to DO #1 and sauté until translucent. Drain the juice from the onions into DO #2 and place them into DO #1. This will be your cooking pot. Pour one half the can of beer into the drained onions. Add the beef and pork (toss the cubes together) to DO #2 (bacon/onion juice) about two lbs. at a time. As the meat browns scoop out, drain, and add to the sautéed onions (DO #1). Add crumbled bacon, tomatoes, ½ of the garlic, paprika, and black pepper. Cook on medium high heat until the meat is tender (about one hour), stirring occasionally. Use enough charcoal briquettes to make the mixture boil lightly; about 20 on top and 10 on the bottom, depending on wind and outside temperature. After the meat is tender add the rest of the ingredients except the pimentos and chocolate (mix the flour with a little water first). Continue cooking for 30 minutes. Remove from heat and cool for about one or two hours to let the mixture absorb the herbs. Start new coals, add the pimentos and chocolate, and cook for fifteen minutes after chili begins to boil, add ground hot chilies to taste and then add salt to taste. Serve alone or over rice or macaroni. Corn bread makes a good side dish.Serves 8-10 chili lovers or as many as 20 regular people."

Cover and cook for an additional 3-5 minutes. Slice and server like quiche. (Real men don't eat quiche, but I sure get lots of requests to cook up this breakfast for them!) Cooking times will vary with the weather, but it's almost impossible to screw up."

On top of the slices, sprinkle one tablespoon of shredded cheese. Fold over the remaining breast half onto the mixture to form a “sandwich.” Wrap one slice of bacon around each “sandwich” and place them in a 12-inch Dutch oven. Pour one-half of the remaining unused marinade sauce over the chicken. Sprinkle the sesame seeds and almond slices over the breasts. Cook at about 350 F.

Maintain an even cooking temperature by rotating the oven between the layers of charcoal every 10 to 15 minutes. Do this by turning the oven 90 degrees in one direction and then rotating the lid back 90 degrees. While the chicken is cooking, cut each slice of cheese along both diagonals to create four triangles. Peel and slice the avocado and slice the tomato into round slices. When the chicken is done, carefully remove each piece and place it on a serving platter. On top of each chicken breast, arrange four cheese triangles in alternating layers presenting a colorful “V” or chevron pattern. The heat from the chicken will melt the cheese slices. On top of the cheese, garnish with slices of avocado and tomato on each breast. Drizzle some of the remaining marinade sauce over the chicken. Top it off with about 1 tablespoon of shredded cheese.

The morning of the dinner, cut up the roast into bite-sized cubes, put the cubes in the Ziplock bag, and add the salad dressing and Worcestershire sauce.  Seal the bag and knead to mix the contents. Put the bag back in the cooler until its time to cook.  It is best if the meat can marinade at least four hours (this imparts a wonderful flavor to the meat as well as tenderizes it). Dice the onion. Saute in the butter in the Dutch oven.  Then add the marinated meat and spices and brown the meat.  After the meat has browned, add the mixed vegetables and stir.  When everything is combined, mix the gravy mix with water in a separate cup per the instructions on the package and add to the stew.  If there is not enough liquid to the mixture, add a little more water.  Cover the Dutch Oven and allow to cook for about 1/2 hour, stirring occasionally.  There will be extra liquid in the stew from the marinade, vegetables, and added water, which will have to be thickened.  To do this, mix the corn starch with cold water in a separate cup until it is a thick white liquid.  Slowly stir this into the stew over heat until it starts to thicken.  Cover and allow to simmer on low heat for 5 - 10 more minutes, stirring frequently. Pull the oven off the fire and uncover.  Place jumbo biscuits on top of the stew leaving a small gap between the biscuits.  Cover the oven and place the oven on a pile of coals, then place coals on the lid.

The fire is really going now, and it's ready for the logs (Twizzlers Candies)! More Candy Corn and Red Hots Candies finish this edible fire, much to the on-looking campers' delight!!\nNOTES: This is a great treat for kids at the end of the day - without the mess and hassle of building a real fire. Next time you do need to build a real fire, the kids will know their terminology. The smallest piece of wood is called the \"Tinder\", and they will look for small leaves because they remembered that the potato chips were small.

Put some of each vegetable on top, watch for carrots that like to roll off. :-) Sprinkle lots of seasoning. Now the tricky part, closing the foil. You make a boat and take the long sides, put them togethe and roll a couple of times (as many as you can). You then take the ends and roll them upwards as far as you can. I take another piece of foil and wrap it again the same way in the same direction. You want to do it in such a way that no juice or steam can escape. Do this until you are out of food. I made six good sized dinners with falafel and 2 with just vegetables. I probably used between 1.5 and 2 cups of falafel mix. Put foil dinners on coals, making sure there are no flames. After about 15 minutes, you can flip the dinners. When you start to smell the food, it probably is done. You really need to just make sure the vegetables are cooked. You can check a dinner at any time and just close it back up if it's not ready. This is a really great dinner. Serve with bread if you have it. I like to put picante sauce on mine."

        "A mixture of garlic and basil inserted under the skin and a combination of lemon, sweet pepper, and additional garlic in the cavity flavor every bite of this grilled chicken.\nRemove the neck and giblets from chicken. Twist wing tips under the back. Cut one of the garlic cloves lengthwise in half. Rub skin of chicken with cut edge of garlic. Place garlic halves, lemon slices, and sweet pepper slices in cavity of chicken. Mince remaining two cloves of garlic. Combine minced garlic, basil, and salt; set aside. Starting at the neck on one side of the breast, slip your fingers between skin and meat, loosening the skin as you work toward the tail end. Once your entire hand is under the skin, free the skin around the thigh and leg area up to, but not around, the tip of the drumstick. Repeat on the other side of the breast. Rub garlic mixture over entire surface under skin. Securely fasten opening with water-soaked wooden toothpicks. Stir together oil and lemon juice; brush over chicken. Arrange preheated coals around a drip pan in a covered grill. Test for medium heat above pan.* Place chicken, breast side up, on grill over drip pan. Cover and grill for 1 to 1-1/4 hours or until chicken is no longer pink and the drumsticks move easily in their sockets, brushing occasionally with oil-lemon mixture. Remove chicken from grill and cover with foil. If desired, serve on a platter with steamed new potatoes and garnish with fresh oregano. Let stand for 5 minutes before carving. Makes 5 servings.\n*Note: To test for medium heat over the grill, you should be able to hold your hand over the drip pan at the height of the food for 4 seconds before having to pull away."

        "This is a easy recipe that you can start and forget about for several hours. This is how it's done, and yes, it may sound rather primitive!\nFind three good sized rocks about the size of a softball, and place them in the campfire to get hot. Sometimes you get a rock that will crack when heated so it is wise to place a couple of extras in to heat, just in case. Oh yes, by the way, the rocks have to get VERY, VERY HOT!!!!!!!! While the rocks are getting hot, take a whole chicken and clean inside and out, then rub it down with salt and pepper to taste. Stuff celery sticks and onion into the chicken. After the rocks are HOT, take a pair of BBQ tongs and stuff  one of the rocks into the chicken with the celery and onion. Place the chicken on a large sheet of tinfoil and take the other two rocks and place one under each wing. Now wrap the chicken in tinfoil, and the more, the better. Remember, if you don't use enough the rocks may burn through and/or you will lose too much heat to cook the bird. Then take wet newspaper and wrap it around the tinfoil. Also make sure you wrap at least 10 layers of newspaper around it, although 20 or more is best. This will hold the heat of the rocks in extremely well. And your done!!!!! The heat of the rocks will cook the chicken in about 3 hours, giving you time to go fishing, for a walk, or take a nap!  :)"

Roll each ball until smooth and arrange snugly in a warm, oiled Dutch oven. Put the lid on and let rise again. You can put 1 or 2 coals on the lid to keep the oven warm if it is cold. Bake about one hour, with four (3 and 1 in the middle) evenly spaced coals underneath, six coals around the lower outside edge, and 16-18 around the rim of the lid.

Roll up the same way as you would for cinnamon rolls. Cut into triangles like this... VVVVVVVVVVV. Line 12 inch Dutch Oven with heavy aluminum foil and spray with Pam. Arrange rolls in a circle, almost touching, tips in. Let rise again until double. Brush tops with egg white or butter and sprinkle with poppy or sesame seeds. Bake at 350 degrees for about 35 minutes. Use about 4-5 coals on the bottom and 20+ on top. Rotate the lid every fifteen minutes to avoid hot spots. After 30 minutes check the rolls for browning. Remember to pull the coals from the bottom about 2/3 the way through. When the rolls begin to brown on top watch closely, pulling the briquettes when they are golden brown. Leave the rolls in the Dutch oven for about five minutes after the heat is removed. The trick to this recipe is to avoid bottom heat, concentrating instead on top and side heat. Makes 10-12 rolls."

Also I didn't define the size of veggies to use as this all depends on how many people you are going to feed. I usually use medium to large sized veggies. Place stew beef in kettle and cover with just enough water to cook the beef (too much water at this time will increase the amount of time it takes to cook the beef). Once the beef is is \"just pink\" on the inside, add all the veggies to the kettle. Add more water to the kettle (see note above about using too much water at this time). Allow everything to cook while adding your favorite seasonings (salt, pepper, garlic, and bay leaf is recommended). By adding small amounts of seasoning during the course of the final cooking process allows you to taylor it to your own tastes, plus it helps you to remember to stir the kettle from time to time. You may wish to add more water as it cooks off. I generally use as little water as possible to keep the stew thick, but it's all up to your taste. Once everything is cooked, just grab a bowl and a spoon and enjoy.\nNOTE:  This stew is meant to be cooked \"all day\" over an open fire. I will usually start it around 1:00 pm and let it slowly cook all afternoon, stirring it \"from time to time\"."

      "½ cup dark molasses",
      "3 Tbs. red wine vinegar",
      "¼ cup soy sauce",
      "2 cups ketchup",
      "Powdered chili peppers or cayenne pepper, according to your own taste"

    "instructions": [
        "Coat the inside of a 12-inch Dutch Oven with Pam. Preheat for 5 minutes with 12-14 briquettes on the bottom and about 20 on top, filling the outside ring of the lid. Melt ½ cube margarine in the oven. Add the pork and the garlic. Brown for about 2 minutes, stirring with a wooden spoon. Cover and add four more briquettes to the center of the lid. Let the Dutch oven heat up for about fifteen minutes, then stir the meat until almost done. Add half a can of beer. Note: the alcohol evaporates at about 180 degrees F.\nWhile the Dutch oven is heating up (see above), chop the vegetables. When the pork is done add these along with the rest of the ingredients except for the pepper powder, add this near the end of cooking to taste. Heat to barely boiling, using about 8-10 briquettes on the bottom and filling the outside ring of the lid. Simmer for about 40 minutes rotating the oven and then the lid every 15 minutes to prevent hot spots. Open to stir several times to check for scorching. If it begins to scorch take away about half of the briquettes from the bottom. (Been there, done that.) Serve with rice, pasta, tortillas, or anything else you conjure up."

    "title": "WHOLE HAM ON THE GRILL",
    "ingredients": [
      "Prepared according to these no-fuss directions, this ham makes the perfect centerpiece for a July Fourth feast.",
      "1 8- to 10-pound cooked shankless whole ham or half ham",
      "1 cup honey",
      "1/4 cup bottled steak sauce",
      "1 teaspoon dry mustard"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Have your butcher trim off fat and remove the bone from the ham; save the ham bone for soup. In a small mixing bowl, stir together honey, steak sauce, and dry mustard. Place ham in a foil roasting pan or a shallow roasting pan. Pour the honey mixture over the ham and into cavity left by the bone. Cover tightly with a large piece of heavy foil. In a grill with a cover, arrange medium-hot coals around a drip pan. Test for medium heat over drip pan.* Place the foil-wrapped ham on grill rack, but not directly over coals. Lower the grill hood and grill for 1-3/4 to 2 hours or till a meat thermometer inserted in the center of the ham registers 140 degrees F. Fold back foil at the top of the ham. Grill for 20 to 30 minutes more to let the ham absorb the grilled flavor. Remove the whole or half ham from the grill. Let the ham stand for 15 minutes. Transfer the ham to a cutting board and cut into slices. Serve the sliced ham with warm cooking juices. Makes 20 to 30 servings.\n*Note: To test for medium heat over the grill, you should be able to hold your hand over the drip pan at the height of the food for 4 seconds before having to pull away."

    "ingredients": [
      "1 whole turkey (any size, I usually do about a 10 lb bird)",
      "Heavy duty aluminum foil",
      "2 cloves garlic",
      "1/2 cup soy sauce",
      "1/4 cup honey",
      "salt and pepper",
      "butter"

    "instructions": [
        "Clean out bird thoroughly, remove organ meat and neck from inside cavity, wash and set aside. Roll out aluminum foil long enough to close around bird with a few extra inches. Roll out 2 to 3 sheets the same length and seam together, side by side (not lengthwise).Place turkey on foil and curl up edges of foil. Salt and pepper inside cavity. Cut small slits in skin of bird and place small amounts of butter under skin in multiple places. Pour soy sauce and honey over bird. Add garlic, organ meats and neck to tinfoil package. Close up and seal all sides (leave top loose so you can open and baste). Place on hot, low campfire grill over an open fire. Baste occasionally, every hour or so until done. It will never dry out, so I just keep it on for hours... turkey falls off the bone! To test if done... slice into turkey to the breastbone, as long as it's not pink, it's done."

    "ingredients": [
      "3 potatoes or 1 cup dried potatoes",
      "3 pkgs Knorr Leek Soup",
      "1 cup uncooked wild rice", 
      "1 chunk of cheddar cheese",
      "1 cup powdered milk",
      "salt and pepper to taste"
    ],
    "instructions": [
        "Reconstitute wild rice all day in a ziplock bag (or cook it for a long time). Reconstitute potatoes if needed or cut fresh potatoes into small chunks. Place potatoes in water in your biggest pot and simmer until soft. Add leek soup mix, water and powdered milk to pot (about 3-4 cups water). Bring to a soft boil. Add wild rice, salt and pepper and small slices of cheese. Add more water as needed. Cook until cheese is melted, potatoes and rice are soft and thickness of soup is desired. Cook 45-60 minutes. Serves 8 hungry campers.\nNOTES: If you like more onions, add fresh or dried to the initial potato/water mixture. When you mix the powdered milk, Knorr Leek soup and water together, mix it with cool water and preferably before you add it to the large pot. The hot potato/water mixture will make the leek soup mix lumpy. I usually use a gas 1 burner stove for this soup so you can adjust the flame. Be careful not to burn the soup. Add ANY leftover cheese you have in your food pack. Squeeze in some margarine if you have a little extra."
